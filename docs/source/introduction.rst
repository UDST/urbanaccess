Introduction
=============

UrbanAccess: A tool for computing GTFS transit and OSM pedestrian networks for accessibility analysis.

Overview
~~~~~~~~~~

UrbanAccess is tool for creating multi-modal graph networks for use in multi-scale (e.g. address level to the metropolitan level) transit accessibility analyses with the network analysis tool Pandana. UrbanAccess uses open data from General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) data to represent disparate operational schedule transit networks and pedestrian OpenStreetMap (OSM) data to represent the pedestrian network. UrbanAccess provides a generalized, computationally efficient, and unified accessibility calculation framework by linking tools for: 1) network data acquisition, validation, and processing; 2) computing an integrated pedestrian and transit weighted network graph; and 3) network analysis using Pandana.

UrbanAccess offers the following tools:

* GTFS and OSM network data acquisition via APIs
* Network data validation and regional network aggregation
* Compute network impedance:

  * by transit schedule day of the week and time of day
  * by transit mode
  * by including average passenger headways to approximate passenger transit stop wait time

* Integrate pedestrian and transit networks to approximate pedestrian scale accessibility
* Resulting networks are designed to be used to compute accessibility metrics using the open source network analysis tool `Pandana <https://github.com/UDST/pandana>`__
