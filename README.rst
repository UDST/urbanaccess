UrbanAccess - Fork notes
========================
Build the Docker image by running `docker build -t udst-urbanaccess .`. Run tests by executing `docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/code udst-urbanaccess ./test.sh`.

When working locally, you may need to clear out the `.pyc` files when running tests after creating container. Do so via: `find . -name \*.pyc -delete`.

UrbanAccess
===========

|Build Status|

A tool for computing GTFS transit and OSM pedestrian networks for
accessibility analysis.

|Integrated AC Transit and BART transit and pedestrian network travel times for Oakland, CA|
*Integrated AC Transit and BART transit and pedestrian network travel times for Oakland, CA*

Overview
========

UrbanAccess is tool for creating multi-modal graph networks for use in
multi-scale (e.g. address level to the metropolitan level) transit
accessibility analyses with the network analysis tool Pandana.
UrbanAccess uses open data from General Transit Feed Specification
(GTFS) data to represent disparate operational schedule transit networks
and pedestrian OpenStreetMap (OSM) data to represent the pedestrian
network. UrbanAccess provides a generalized, computationally efficient,
and unified accessibility calculation framework by linking tools for: 1)
network data acquisition, validation, and processing; 2) computing an
integrated pedestrian and transit weighted network graph; and 3) network
analysis using Pandana.

UrbanAccess offers the following tools:

* GTFS and OSM network data acquisition via APIs
* Network data validation and regional network aggregation
* Compute network impedance:

  * by transit schedule day of the week and time of day
  * by transit mode
  * by including average passenger headways to approximate passenger transit stop wait time

* Integrate pedestrian and transit networks to approximate pedestrian scale accessibility
* Resulting networks are designed to be used to compute accessibility
  metrics using the open source network analysis tool
  `Pandana <https://github.com/UDST/pandana>`__

  * Compute cumulative accessibility metrics
  * Nearest feature analysis using POIs

Current status
--------------

UrbanAccess is currently in a alpha release and only compatible with
Python 2.x. Further code refinements are expected.

*Forthcoming improvements:*

- Unit tests
- Python 3

Reporting bugs
--------------

Please report any bugs you encounter via `GitHub
issues <https://github.com/UDST/urbanaccess/issues>`__.

Contributing to UrbanAccess
---------------------------

If you have improvements or new features you would like to see in
UrbanAccess:

1. Open a feature request via `GitHub issues <https://github.com/UDST/urbanaccess/issues>`__.
2. Contribute your code from a fork or branch by using a Pull Request and request a review so it can be considered as an addition to the codebase.

Install the latest release
--------------------------

conda
~~~~~~
conda installation is forthcoming.

pip
~~~~~~
UrbanAccess is available on PyPI and can be installed with::

    pip install -U urbanaccess

Development Installation
------------------------

UrbanAccess is currently in a alpha release and further code refinements are expected. As such, it is suggested to install using the ``develop`` command rather than ``install``. Make sure you are using the latest version of the code base by using git's ``git pull`` inside the cloned repository.

To install UrbanAccess follow these steps:

1. Git clone the `UrbanAccess repo <https://github.com/udst/urbanaccess>`__
2. in the cloned directory run: ``python setup.py develop``

To update to the latest development version:

Use ``git pull`` inside the cloned repository

Documentation and demo
----------------------

Documentation for UrbanAccess can be found
`here <https://udst.github.io/urbanaccess/index.html>`__.

A demo jupyter notebook for UrbanAccess can be found in the `demo
directory <https://github.com/UDST/urbanaccess/tree/master/demo>`__.

Minimum GTFS data requirements
------------------------------

The minimum `GTFS data
types <https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/>`__ required to use
UrbanAccess are: ``stop_times``, ``stops``, ``routes``, ``calendar``,
and ``trips`` however if there is no ``calendar``, ``calendar_dates``
can be used as a replacement.
